Contact Manager Application - Final Project
This project is a Contact Manager Application where users can easily add, edit, and delete contacts, all while ensuring secure programming practices. The primary goal of this project is to improve the robustness and security of a previously developed contact manager system by performing input validation, adding unit tests, and applying static analysis tools. The application manages user contacts, storing details like name, email, and phone number.

What’s New for This Project?
Input Validation: One of the key security improvements is ensuring the contact information entered by the user is valid. For example, it validates that email addresses and phone numbers follow the proper formats to prevent malformed or malicious inputs.

Unit Testing: We’ve added tests to make sure the system behaves as expected, catching potential bugs before they reach the user. These tests help improve the reliability of the contact manager, especially when it comes to adding, deleting, and updating contacts.

Static Analysis: We’ve applied static analysis tools to identify vulnerabilities and improve code quality, ensuring that our code is as secure as possible.

Version Control: We use Git for version control, which helps track changes and collaborate more effectively, especially if working in a team.

How It Works
Adding Contacts: You can add a new contact by providing the name, email, and phone number. The system checks that the inputs are valid and stores them safely.

Deleting Contacts: Contacts can be deleted by name, and the system ensures that the deletion process happens without errors.

Viewing Contacts: Users can view the list of contacts that have been added to the system.

Why It Matters
As we move into a more connected world, it’s crucial that the software we write is secure, reliable, and user-friendly. This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice securing software through proper validation, automated testing, and applying best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.
